#Data Structures using C
This repository contains implementations of various data structures using the C programming language. Each data structure is implemented with clear explanations and examples for better understanding.

**Data Structures Included**
Arrays: Basic array operations and algorithms.
Linked Lists: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list implementations.
Stacks: Array-based and linked list-based stack implementations.
Queues: Array-based and linked list-based queue implementations.
Trees: Binary search tree, AVL tree, red-black tree, and others.
Graphs: Adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations.
Hash Tables: Basic hash table implementation.
More data structures will be added progressively.

**How to Use**
Each data structure is implemented in its own directory. Inside each directory, you will find the C source code along with relevant header files. To use a particular data structure, simply include the corresponding header file in your C program and link the source file.
For example, to use a linked list, include linkedlists.h in your program and link linkedlists.c.
Additionally, each data structure directory contains example usage code (example.c) demonstrating how to use the data structure.

**Contributing**
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new data structure implementations to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please follow the existing code style and structure.
