# Data Structures using C  <br>
This repository contains implementations of various data structures using the C programming language. Each data structure is implemented with clear explanations and examples for better understanding.  <br>

**Data Structures Included: ** <br>
Arrays: Basic array operations and algorithms. <br>
Linked Lists: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list implementations. <br>
Stacks: Array-based and linked list-based stack implementations. <br>
Queues: Array-based and linked list-based queue implementations. <br>
Trees: Binary search tree, AVL tree, red-black tree, and others. <br>
Graphs: Adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations. <br>
Hash Tables: Basic hash table implementation. <br>
More data structures will be added progressively. <br>

**How to Use: **  <br>
Each data structure is implemented in its own directory. Inside each directory, you will find the C source code along with relevant header files. To use a particular data structure, simply include the corresponding header file in your C program and link the source file.  <br>
For example, to use a linked list, include linkedlists.h in your program and link linkedlists.c.  <br>
Additionally, each data structure directory contains example usage code (example.c) demonstrating how to use the data structure.  <br>

**Contributing: ** <br>
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new data structure implementations to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please follow the existing code style and structure. <br>
